there is two way to access and create vm server

with password (eg provided by lenode and created on vm ware )
with ssh key .pem(for powershell ) and .pak(for putty)
 and also we have option for no security access

through ssh
ssh -i "C:\Users\sachin\Downloads\sachin.pem" ubuntu@ec2-3-234-219-66.compute-1.amazonaws.com
this thing we can get on aws site

through putty
if: generate private key
laod key
make login with username and password as in video

if we have password
ssh sachin@122.123.141.12
then enter password

without password 
direct longin 

and we can also login in ghrome with aws link that is shown on site only
ssh root@your_server_ip
ssh root@165.232.177.116
adduser bunty
usermod -aG sudo bunty (giving sudo access)
ufw allow OpenSSH
ufw enable (enabling firewall no access would be given no respond on othet then ssh )
sudo su
exit


using nano command 
ctrl x y enter (save and exit)

//pass
